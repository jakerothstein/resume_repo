# Resume Repository

Welcome to my resume repository! This repository contains the source code for my LaTeX resume, as well as the compiled PDF version.

## Overleaf Link

You can view and edit my resume directly on Overleaf using the following link:
[Overleaf Project](https://www.overleaf.com/project/68421e93ff955b76deb104f0)

## Files

- `resume.tex`: The LaTeX source file for my resume.
- `Resume.pdf`: The compiled PDF version of my resume.

## How to Compile

If you'd like to compile the resume locally, ensure you have LaTeX installed on your system. Then run the following command:

```bash
pdflatex resume.tex
```

This will generate the `Resume.pdf` file in the same directory.
